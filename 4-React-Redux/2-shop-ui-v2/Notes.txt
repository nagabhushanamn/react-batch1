problems in current application?


==> view/rendering-logic + state & state-logic are coupled ,together


        -> cannot re-use same state in multiple components
        -> UI component testing very difficult



soln:

        using MVC design pattern

        M ==> model/state
        V ==> View
        C ==> Controller

        Limitation:

            => its always use 2-way data-binding


            M1   -     V1

            M2   /     V2 
                 \
            M3  /      V3
           
           probs : 
           
             ==> debugging UI application data-flow is always difficult
             ==> very difficult to introduce/revoew  models & views
             ==> can't develope UI components with single responsibility
             



   best-soln :

            => use 'flux' design pattern from facebook, with uni-directional flow
